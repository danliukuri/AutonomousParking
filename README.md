This project focuses on using reinforcement learning techniques to teach an intelligent agent how to navigate and park a car accurately in various parking scenarios.

The software development process was iterative, with a lot of [model training](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/wW80LL6ySPGVxk6jJeQvRw) in general, which can be found on the TensorBoard.dev link provided.
Also, for convenience, [final attempts](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/snac9DewTPWmc1rOr1o9kA) were selected separately.

Parking lots were designed using a reference database, [dimensions.com](https://www.dimensions.com).

The elements of the parking lots were created using Unity's built-in tools. For the cars, ready-made models from the [“Low Poly Soviet Cars Pack”](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/low-poly-soviet-cars-pack-184453) were used.
